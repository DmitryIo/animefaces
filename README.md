# Objective

**To build a model that can convert pixel images into array of numbers**

My main goal was creating a programm which would be able to preprocess and work with images. At that time i was watching some Japaneese cartoons, and that is why i decided to make a project connected to machine learning problem. How can computer work with such images?

It is easy to see similarity for human between these photoes. But how can a computer can solve this problem?
